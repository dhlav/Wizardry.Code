Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.


Release #:	WC043 - Kandi spell enhancements
================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	20-Mar-2024.

Contributors:	Eric Labelle.

Enhancements:	The Kandi spell (find character location) now gives the precise location of a dead character in the maze instead of just the general area. Furthermore, Kandi now gives the character's camp location in the maze when using the D)isband option.

Note:		This reduces the Kandi spell programming space and thus its Pascal coding segment size sufficiently to cross a block in downsize thus giving almost an entire 512 bytes of extra coding space for future enhancements coming after this one.
