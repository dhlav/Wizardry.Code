Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Pascal Code Changes
===================================================

The baseline is the re-engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) from the Wizardry_I program by Thomas William Ewers. This project would not exist without it.



Enhancement #:	WC041 - Do not transfer quest items - Show full 4-digits year on splash screen
==============================================================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	05-Feb-2024.

Contributors:	Eric Labelle.

Enhancements:   Revert the code done in WC040 to disallow characters to be transferred between scenario disks when they are carrying quest items.

Information:	This was done in WC040 to facilitate transferring characters between Proving Grounds and other alternate PG scenarios. But that has potential undesirable effects upon the transfer to the Knight of Diamonds scenario when using the transfer utility from the PG boot disk instead of the KOD boot disk.
	
Enhancements:   On splash screen upon boot show 4 digits for date year instead of 2 digits.

Following are the programming code details
==========================================

Enhancement:	Revert - Allow characters to be transferred between scenario disks even if they are carrying quest items.
